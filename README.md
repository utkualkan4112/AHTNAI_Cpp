# AHTNAI_Cpp
 This is the implementation of this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319297595_Modified_Adversarial_Hierarchical_Task_Network_Planning_in_Real-Time_Strategy_Games
 in C++ and it's the version that is not only for the MicroRst competition game. With well writen strategy table it would work for any game AI. Detailed implementation of this to any game guide will be written soon.
