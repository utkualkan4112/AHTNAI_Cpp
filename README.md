AHTNAI_Cpp is an implementation of the Adversarial Hierarchical Task Network (AHTN) AI planning algorithm in C++, based on the research paper "Modified Adversarial Hierarchical Task Network Planning in Real-Time Strategy Games" by Ontañón et al. (2017). The project aims to provide a flexible and adaptable AI solution that can be integrated into various game genres and environments.

Key Features:

Generalized AHTN Implementation:

Unlike the original paper, which focused on the MicroRTS competition game, AHTNAI_Cpp extends the AHTN algorithm to be applicable to any game AI.
By designing a well-structured strategy table, developers can customize and adapt the AI to suit the specific requirements of their game.
C++ Implementation:

The project is implemented in C++, offering performance benefits and compatibility with a wide range of game engines and development environments.
The codebase is designed to be modular, readable, and maintainable, facilitating easy integration and extension.
Adversarial Planning:

AHTNAI_Cpp incorporates adversarial planning techniques, allowing the AI to consider and anticipate the actions of opposing players or entities.
This enables the AI to make strategic decisions and adapt its behavior based on the dynamic game state and the actions of adversaries.
Hierarchical Task Decomposition:

The AHTN algorithm employs a hierarchical task decomposition approach, breaking down high-level goals into smaller, manageable subtasks.
This hierarchical structure allows for efficient planning and execution of complex behaviors, enabling the AI to handle diverse game scenarios and objectives.
Real-Time Decision Making:

AHTNAI_Cpp is designed to operate in real-time environments, making decisions and adapting its plans based on the evolving game state.
The AI can respond to changes in the game world, such as player actions, resource availability, and game events, ensuring dynamic and responsive gameplay.
Upcoming Features:

Detailed Implementation Guide:
A comprehensive guide on integrating AHTNAI_Cpp into any game will be provided in the near future.
The guide will cover the necessary steps, best practices, and considerations for incorporating the AHTN AI into various game genres and engines.
AHTNAI_Cpp represents a significant contribution to the field of game AI, offering a powerful and flexible solution for implementing intelligent and adaptive adversarial AI in a wide range of games. By leveraging the AHTN algorithm and extending its applicability beyond the original research paper, this project opens up new possibilities for creating engaging and challenging AI opponents.
